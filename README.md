## Aim

On holiday, many vahicles moving between cities even country, especially on a long holidays.
In spite, it's not a good idea to have many vehicles going out of town on this pandemic.
That's why some countries impose restrictions on vehicles during holidays on this pandemic.

Therefore, I was thinking what if I try to make a program that can tell wether a vehicle should be restricted.

## Workflow

> This program is based on Indonesian number plate code

As you might know, the restriction system is carried out by matching the **vehicle number plate code** with the destination **region number plate code**.
So in this program, the region number plate codes are stored in a database.

## User Input

The inputed region from user **doesn't need capital** letter rule, because **the program will capitalize** the user input.
